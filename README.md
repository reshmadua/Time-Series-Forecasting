# Time-Series-Forecasting
Problem Statement : Predicting India’s External debt using ARIMA. 

# Objective :  
1)	To study the trends of all the components determining India’s external debt.
2)	To predict India’s external debt for the next few years.

# Dataset : 
The Dataset is obtained from RBI’s official website. It is a Time Series Data on India’s external debt from 1991 to 2020. The dataset contains 64 features which have been categorised into 12 broad categories namely:
